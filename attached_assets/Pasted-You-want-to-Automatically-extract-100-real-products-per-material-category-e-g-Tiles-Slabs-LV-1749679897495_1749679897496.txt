You want to:

Automatically extract 100+ real products per material category (e.g., Tiles, Slabs, LVT, Hardwood, Heating, Carpet)

Pull product specs, sizes, finishes, colors, PEI/DCOF ratings, and images

Get this data directly from manufacturer websites like:

Daltile

MSI

Arizona Tile

Florida Tile

AKDO

Load all that into your system (e.g., Airtable or JSON files in Replit) to display and compare by category

✅ All of this without APIs, login tokens, or paid services.

⚙️ How It’s Going to Be Done (Step-by-Step)
1. Use Your Existing Comperra Scraper
Your backend already uses:

js
Copy
Edit
const axios = require('axios');
const cheerio = require('cheerio');
This lets you fetch and parse any public product page, just like a browser would.

2. Find Product Listing Pages
For each brand, you:

Go to their product category pages manually (e.g., Daltile’s Tile section)

Copy/paste all the product URLs into a CSV or text list

Example:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://www.daltile.com/products/terrazzo-look/outlander/sterling
https://www.msisurfaces.com/porcelain/brickstone-red/
...
✅ You do not need an API — these pages are public.

3. Bulk Scrape All URLs
Use your existing /api/scrape/bulk endpoint to:

Upload a .csv of product URLs

Automatically scrape and store the results (name, size, finish, image, etc.)

js
Copy
Edit
POST /api/scrape/bulk
Body: CSV file with 100+ URLs
Your scraper will loop through each and extract structured fields like:

Name

Size

Finish

Thickness

DCOF / PEI

Image URL

Category

4. Auto-Assign Category Based on URL
You already have this logic:

js
Copy
Edit
function assignCategoryFromURL(url) {
  if (url.includes('tile')) return 'Tile';
  if (url.includes('slab')) return 'Slab';
  if (url.includes('lvt') || url.includes('vinyl')) return 'LVT';
  ...
}
This means as you scrape, the system auto-tags each product with its correct material category.

5. Save & Import to Airtable
Once scraped:

Store each product as a JSON file in /tile-data

Optionally, send them to Airtable via /api/import/airtable

6. Display by Category
On the frontend, when users click a tab like "Tile", your table will:

Show only products with category === "Tile"

No mixing of hardwood or slab
